                Deceptive-design or dark-design refers to those annoying, sneaky or dishonest elements in a service (usually digital), this can be in the form of annoying cookie settings popups and manipulative language all of which are used to get something from you the user that you would not usually give.
            </p>
           
            <div class = "paragraph-image">
                <img src="/Images/w-t-f-dark-pattern-design.webp" alt="">
                <div id="demo-container">
                    
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
            One example of a deceptive design is in cookie privacy settings. These settings usually come the options that enable all cookies or a button to accept all with a separate less noticeable button to actually use your specifications.

                <img src="/Images/amazon-deletion-3.png" alt="">
                <div id="demo-container">
                    
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                another common practice is making it very easy to sign up for a service but nearly impossible to delete your account. this is done because if a company can keep your email and your account you may have a higher chance of using them in the future or maybe they can continue to use adn sell your user data
