                <span class = 'highlight'>Color plays an important role</span> in every design you see. Every website, book, or product uses color in some way; it could be to make the theme feel serious or to make the content more light. This page depicts a good use of color, and the effect should be unnoticed as a good design shouldn't usually draw attention. If the palette were brighter and more energetic, it would substantially change how you understand the site.

            <p>Colors are usually grouped into warm or energetic, cool or calming and neutral, with plenty of others in between. Energetic colors would be the high brightness and extreme ends of a color. For example, red is usually used in high energy pallets and draws more <span style="background:red">attention</span> than other colors. Red can also play a role in a <span style="background:#e17c7c">calming</span> palette if its shade is toned down to be more muted and less saturated.

            <p>On the cool side, we have colors like blue and green. These colors are often found in slower more methodical uses and are typically thought to relax people. Blue has been shown to help people make more strategic and well-thought decisions, which contrasts against red's effect of rash or aggressive decisions. These colors are used in multiple mediums to calm or warn people.</p>
