                <span class = 'highlight'>Color plays an important role</span> in every design you see every website, book or product uses color. This depicts a good use of color, and the effect should be unnoticed as a good design should'nt usually draw attention. If the palette were brighter more energetic it would substantially change how you understand the site.

Energetic colors would be the high brightness and extreme end of a color. For example red, red is usually used in high energy pallets and draws more <span style="background:red">attention</span> than other colors, red can also play a role ina calming palette if its shade is toned down to be more <span style="background:#e17c7c">calming</span> </p>
